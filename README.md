# GLPI Manual IP Check Plugin

A GLPI plugin to detect and list computers with manually configured IP addresses in the inventory. It scans JSON inventory files, logs processed files, and provides a user interface to view manual IPs and clear stored data.

## Features
- Identifies computers with manual IPs by analyzing GLPI inventory JSON files.
- Logs processed JSON files with timestamps for tracking.
- Displays manual IP details (computer, workgroup, user, IP, MAC, date).
- Includes manual scan and storage cleanup functionality.
- Supports Portuguese (Brazil) localization.

## Requirements
- **GLPI**: Versions 10.0.0 to 10.1.99
- **PHP**: 7.4 or higher
